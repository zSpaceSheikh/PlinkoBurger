## Plinko Burger - IT'S HAPPENING

- *Now with actual swag*

Lot's of exciting things are in motion as we as Plinko Burger Headquarters prepare to present at GDC. First off, we made these dope pins for our team members, with buttons for players coming soon.

And the game got a major face-lift update as we lean more heavily into the retro diner-style aesthetic, with more game updates coming soon.

We are so delighted to be able to continue this project and bring it to GDC. The whole Plinko Burger team is working diligently to wipe our countertops and clean these grills. The newest version of Plinko Burger wil be the best one yet! 


## Plinko Burger, A Game People Might Continue to Play!?

 - *It's not over yet!*

Plinko Burger has been given another life (suprises incoming soon!) and as such, it will be getting some new updates! (*distant cheering and sobbing)* 

The first major update has been to revamp the start screen and end screens to both feel more cool, and also set the scene a little better for the game with a retro diner vibe.
