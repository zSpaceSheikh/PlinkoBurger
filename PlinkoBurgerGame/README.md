We are so delighted to be able to continue this project and bring it to GDC. The whole Plinko Burger team is working diligently to wipe our countertops and clean these grills. The newest version of Plinko Burger wil be the best one yet! 


## Plinko Burger, A Game People Might Continue to Play!?

 - *It's not over yet!*

Plinko Burger has been given another life (suprises incoming soon!) and as such, it will be getting some new updates! (*distant cheering and sobbing)* 

The first major update has been to revamp the start screen to both feel more cool, and also set the scene a little better for the game.
